# WoodCarverClone
Clone of a wood carving game

### Installation

Clone the project into your system. Create Textures and Models folders inside the Assets folder. Place the appropriate textures and models in these folders. Project was done in Unity 2019.4 but uses built-in render pipeline and almost no dependencies therefore it should be compatible with a wide range of Unity versions.
